# Nam Vo
This caffe fork adds some embedding loss layers used in our ECCV 2016 work:
- Localizing and Orienting Street Views Using Overhead Imagery, Nam Vo and James Hays

The plan is to implement some common loss functions for embedding (comparing features):
- Contrastive loss (Siamese network)
- Hinge loss for triplet, or ranking loss (ranking/triplet network)
- Our DBL log loss for pair (Siamese network)
- Our DBL log loss for triplet (triplet network)

Example mining strategy: exhausting (use every pair/triplet), work in combination with the data layer that will create valid pair of mini-batches.

For now, only exhausting triplet DBL log loss is implemented and verified to work correctly.
